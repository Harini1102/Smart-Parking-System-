# Smart Parking System Using Arudino

<p align="justify">smart parking system is an on-site development of an IOT module that is used to monitor and signalize the state of availability of each single parking space. It shows on the display monitor that how many parking places have been filled how many has to fill more.</p>

## OVERVIEW
<p align="justify">
Smart Parking System consists of car parking spot,each spot is represented with number.At the entry of parking lot servo motor are installed along with IR sensor to detect the object and lift the rod using servo motor.IR Sensor is coonected to Display monitor which shows that how many parking places have been filled how many has to fill more. If the parking slots are filled, it doesn’t allow any vehicle to go into the parking lot it displays in the display monitor that the slots have been filled. If any vehicle comes out the parking lot then only one vehicle is allowed to fill the slot.</p>

## COMPONENTS USED
- Arduino - 1
- Breadboard - 1
- Servo motor SG-90 - 1
- LCD (16*2) - 1
- IR Obstacle sensor - 2
- Resistors (1k,1k,4.7k)
- Jumper Wires
- Battery Cell - 2
- Battery holder and switch

## SOFTWARE USED
- Arduino IDE - [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## SETUP AND CALIBRATION
### (A) Arduino Setup
* To download and set up Arduino Uno on a Windows computer, start by visiting the Arduino website by clicking on the hyperlink mentioned in the above section.
* Download the latest release of the Arduino IDE (as per the configurations of your system). Click the provided link to initiate the download.
* Once the download is complete, double-click the executable (.exe) file to begin the driver installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions in the installation guide.
* In the first step, make sure that you select all the components to install (Arduino software, USB driver, start menu shortcut, associate .ino files).
* Choose the installation directory in the next step. The installation process will extract and install all the required files to execute the Arduino Software properly.
* After the process is completed, you can choose to close the window or select the option 'Run Arduino IDE'. With the Arduino IDE installed, you are ready to start programming your Arduino Uno.

### (B) To use the Smart Parking System we need to follow these steps
* Connect Arduino Uno to desktop/laptop using USB cable. Verify the code in desktop/laptop in Arduino IDE and then select correct serial com port.
* Now upload the code to Arduino Uno board and remove USB cable after successfully uploading the code.
* Setup and connect all the components with Arduino Uno Board.

## USAGE
<p align="justify">The system shows on the display monitor that how many parking places have been filled how many has to fill more  using IR sensors to identify the car or object and LCD for display.If the parking slots are filled, it doesn’t allow any vehicle to go into the parking lot it displays in the display monitor that the slots have been filled. If any vehicle comes out the parking lot then only one vehicle is allowed to fill the slot.</p>
